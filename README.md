# Sudoku
Experimenting with solving and generating Sudoku puzzles with Python.

## Setup and Running
* Just download/clone, and I have powershell scripts right now to run it. I suppose I could set up bash or command prompt scripts as well, but for now that's what we've got.

## TODO
* Make table more readable with lines between blocks.
* Check if a solution is valid. We can check, just how we handle that.
* Use solution checking to use contradiction to find solutions at dead ends.
* Make form prettier.
* Make bottom margin bigger.
* Redo docstrings to match reST.
